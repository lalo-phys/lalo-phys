## Hi there 👋

This repository highlights my journey and motivations for Computational Programming and Molecular Simulation, with particular interest in research projects within the field of soft condensed matter and beyond.

## Why This Path?

The intersection of computational science and soft condensed matter physics presents a dynamic and increasingly crucial area of study. Here's why I'm driven to explore this field:

* **Computational Power for Complex Systems:** Soft condensed matter, with its inherent complexity, demands powerful computational tools. Through advanced programming and simulation, we can unlock insights into the behavior of these systems, which are often intractable through traditional experimental methods alone.
  
* **Interdisciplinary Exploration:** Merging principles from physics, computer science, and materials science. This allows me to tackle multifaceted research problems and develop innovative solutions.
  
* **Advancements in Soft Matter Research:** Soft condensed matter is ubiquitous, playing a vital role in everything from biological systems to advanced materials. Now I'm working in:
  
    * Aggregates of proteins.
    * Trimerization free energy for self-assembly of molecules with SAFT theory.
    * Self assembly of capsids with molecular simulation.
      
* **Constantly Evolving Field:** The fields of computational programming and Soft Condensed Matter research are fields that are constantly evolving. This creates an environment of constant learning, that greatly motivates me.

Feel free to explore and connect!
