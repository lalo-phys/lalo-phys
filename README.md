## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository highlights my journey and motivations for pursuing a Master's of Science(physics) with a focus on Computational Programming and Simulation, with particular interest in research projects within the field of soft condensed matter and beyond.

## Why This Path?

The intersection of computational science and soft condensed matter physics presents a dynamic and increasingly crucial area of study. Here's why I'm driven to explore this field:

* **Computational Power for Complex Systems:** Soft condensed matter, with its inherent complexity, demands powerful computational tools. Through advanced programming and simulation, we can unlock insights into the behavior of these systems, which are often intractable through traditional experimental methods alone.
  
* **Interdisciplinary Exploration:** This master's program fosters an interdisciplinary approach, merging principles from physics, computer science, and materials science. This allows me to tackle multifaceted research problems and develop innovative solutions.
  
* **Advancements in Soft Matter Research:** Soft condensed matter is ubiquitous, playing a vital role in everything from biological systems to advanced materials. By honing my computational skills, I aim to contribute to cutting-edge research in areas like:
    * Aggregates of proteins
    * trimerization free energy for self-assembly of molecules
    * Self assembly of capsids
      
* **Constantly Evolving Field:** The fields of computational programming and Soft Condensed Matter research are fields that are constantly evolving. This creates an environment of constant learning, that greatly motivates me.

This repository will serve as a platform to share my progress, research projects, and insights gained throughout my master's journey.
